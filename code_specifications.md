# 1. Function naming convention
All of the function naming must be meaningful and using big camelCase.
Depending on the function, the function name begins with the following fields shown in the table.

|Field|Function|
|:------:|:------|
|Get|Indicates that the main purpose of this function is to return a value|
|On|This function is not called by you actively, but the system (or framework) will automatically call it when a specific event occurs.|
